# AfricasTalking Ruby Gem

> Provides convenient access to the Africa's Talking API from applications written in ruby.

## Documentation
Take a look at the [API docs here](http://docs.africastalking.com).

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem "AfricasTalking", :git => "git@github.com:Michaelmwirigi/africastalking-ruby.git"
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

<!-- Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install AfricasTalking -->

## Usage

The SDK needs to be instantiated using your username and API key, which you can get from the [dashboard](https://account/africastalking.com).

> You can use this SDK for either production or sandbox apps. For sandbox, the app username is **ALWAYS** `sandbox`

```ruby
username = 'YOUR_USERNAME'; # use 'sandbox' for development in the test environment
apiKey 	= 'YOUR_API_KEY'; # use your sandbox app API key for development in the test environment
@gateway=AfricasTalking::Gateway.new(username, apiKey)

You can now make API calls using the @gateway object
